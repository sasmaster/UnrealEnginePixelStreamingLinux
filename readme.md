## Aidan Possemiers' fork of the Unreal Engine
=====================================

This fork contains the branches for my open pull requests against the upstream UnrealEngine repository, as well as branches for projects such as [Pixel Streaming for Linux](https://adamrehn.com/articles/pixel-streaming-in-linux-containers/):

- [4.25-pixelstreaming](https://github.com/ImmortalEmperor/UnrealEngine/tree/4.25-pixelstreaming): contains the implementation of **Pixel Streaming for Linux** targeting Unreal Engine **4.25** (if you're looking for the old 4.23.1 version then head over to [Adam Rehn's fork](https://github.com/adamrehn/UnrealEngine/tree/4.23.1-pixelstreaming), which contains the relevant branches.)
